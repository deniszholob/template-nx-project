Storybook helps you build UI components in isolation from your app's business logic, data, and context.
That makes it easy to develop hard to reach states.
Save these UI states as **stories** to revisit during development, testing aor QA.

Buils UIs with a [**component-driven**](https://componentdriven.org) process starting with atomic components and ending with pages
